1. Open Anaconda prompt
2. Create GDAL environment and install GDAL with 'conda create -n gdal_works gdal'
3. Navigate to environment folder with 'cd %LOCALAPPDATA%\Continuum\Anaconda2\envs\gdal_works'
4. They should exist, but if they do not:
	- mkdir .\etc\conda\activate.d
	- mkdir .\etc\conda\deactivate.d
5. Create env_vars.bat in activate.d and add text 'set GDAL_DATA=%LOCALAPPDATA%\Continuum\Anaconda2\envs\gdal_works\Library\share\gdal'
6. Create env_vars.bat in deactivate.d and add text 'set GDAL_DATA='
7. Back in prompt, type 'activate gdal_works'
8. To test:
	- Download https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B8toI67HoVSrdkxYc2ZSX3NGcUk/view?usp=sharing
	- In Anaconda prompt, navigate to folder with above file, which is an SRTM tile in HGT format
	- To test GDAL installation in general, type 'gdal_translate N10E034.hgt N10E034.tif'
	- There should now be a GeoTIFF version of this file
	- To test whether GDAL_DATA is set properly, type 'gdalwarp -t_srs "EPSG:32636" N10E034.tif N10E034_utm.tif'
	- There should now be a GeoTIFF version of the file in UTM Zone 36 N projection (originally in unprojected WGS84). 
	  Confirm that both new files look reasonable in a GIS.
9. If you wish to use Jupyter Notebook or Spyder with GDAL, you must install and launch them through this environment
10. If you wish to deactivate GDAL environment, type 'deactivate' in prompt
